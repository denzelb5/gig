# NSS Front-End Capstone -- "GigMeister"
Create an application using the following:

## Specs

* REACT
* Firebase CRUD
* Bootstrap
* Use Github Projects for Planning

## Technologies Used

* HTML5, CSS, Javascript
* SASS 4.13.1 for all customized styling
* React 16.12.0 for core app functionality
* Firebase 7.7.0 for authentication and data storage

## Description:

An application for classical musicians to create and edit a large scale ensemble such as a symphony orchestra.  A user can create an event, choose what instrumentation is needed, and then assign the players needed to the event.  The app then creates a roster with all of the event's pertinent information and personnel assigned to the gig.  

Future plans include:
* Adding calendar functionality
* Expense / income tracking for tax purposes
* Ability to track income earned and services rendered for private instruction.
* Ability to track responses from instrumentalists hired
